// Abstraction refers to the process of simplifying complex ideas or concepts



// Provider	A Provider(in ethers) is a class which provides an abstraction for a connection to the Ethereum Network.It provides read - only access to the Blockchain and its status.	 


// Signer	A Signer is a class which (usually) in some way directly or indirectly has access to a private key, which can sign messages and transactions to authorize the network to charge your account ether to perform operations.	 



// Contract	A Contract is an abstraction which represents a connection to a specific contract on the Ethereum Network, so that applications can use it like a normal JavaScript object.



// Connecting to Ethereum: RPC


// const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider();

// // If you don't specify a //url//, Ethers connects to the default 


// // (i.e. ``http:/\/localhost:8545``)

// // The provider also allows signing transactions to
// // send ether and pay to change state within the blockchain.
// // For this, we need the account signer...
// const signer = provider.getSigner()


// A Provider in ethers is a read - only abstraction to access the blockchain data.

// Once you have a Provider, you have a read-only connection to the blockchain, which you can use to query the current state, fetch historic logs, look up deployed code and so on.


// contract.connect( providerOrSigner ) â‡’ Contractsource




// Returns a new instance of the Contract, but connected to providerOrSigner.



// By passing in a Provider, this will return a downgraded Contract which only has read - only access(i.e.constant calls).




// By passing in a Signer.this will return a Contract which will act on behalf of that signer.



// contract.deployTransaction 



// If the Contract object is the result of a ContractFactory deployment, this is the transaction which was used to deploy the contract.



// The Contract object makes it easier to use an on - chain Contract as a normal JavaScript object, with the methods mapped to encoding and decoding data for you.



// If you are familiar with Databases, this is similar to an Object Relational Mapper(ORM).


// This class is a meta - class, which means its methods are constructed at runtime, and when you pass in the ABI to the constructor it uses it to determine which methods to add.

// While an on - chain Contract may have many methods available, you can safely ignore any methods you don't need or use, providing a smaller subset of the ABI to the contract.

// An ABI often comes from the Solidity or Vyper compiler, but you can use the Human - Readable ABI in code, which the following examples use.
// In order to communicate with the Contract on - chain, this class needs to know what methods are available and how to encode and decode the data, which is what the Application Binary Interface(ABI) provides.



//  The Contract object
// const daiContract = new ethers.Contract(daiAddress, daiAbi, provider);
